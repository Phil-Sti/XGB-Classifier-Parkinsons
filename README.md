# XGB-Classifier-Parkinsons
Mini machine learning project using XGBoost algorithm

The dataset used is an interesting usecase as it is only 195 rows long, making it a challenge for models as per overfitting.
The use of XGBoost is part of my ongoing discovery of algorithms beyond Tensorflow.
As such, the results are rather impressive.

You will find the colab notebook with all necessary installs and imports to run on you own runtime.
